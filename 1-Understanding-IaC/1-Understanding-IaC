## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)? 

-  The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources  such as servers, networks, storage, and databases  through code instead of through manual processes.

## What are the advantages of IaC patterns? 
1. [Automation] : IaC allows us to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources. This automation reduces manual errors, increases consistency, and speeds up deployment.

2. [Consistency] : an infrastructure deployed and managed using code should be uniform and predictable across different environments, regardless of where it is deployed or by whom

3. [Scalability] : IaC allows to easily scale infrastructure resources up or down based on demand. We can adjust configurations in the code and apply those changes across multiple instances.

4. [Version control] : IaC code can be stored in version control systems like Git. This enables collaboration, history tracking, and the ability to roll back changes if needed.

## What is the purpose of version control in IaC? 

- It allows for tracking of infrastructure configurations over time

## How does IaC improve collaboration among teams?

- Teams can work together by using a shared, version-controlled codebase for infrastructure management

## How does IaC provide scalability?

- Through automating the provisioning and scaling of infrastructure resources

## How does IaC provide consistency?

- By using infrastructure configurations that are deployed in a repeatable way
